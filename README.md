# Why Create This Repository?
As more platforms release their own documentation tailored for LLM reading, this repository aims to:
1. Aggregate all these LLM-specific documentation resources
2. Provide a centralized knowledge base for prompt engineering
3. Ensure regular updates to keep pace with evolving platform guidelines

## Cline's Rules System
The most effective implementation currently uses Cline's rules-bank system. To integrate:

1. Clone the project into your root directory's `rules-bank` folder:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rules-bank.git
```

2. Move relevant documentation to the .clinerules folder as needed, following this structure:
```
project-root/
├── .clinerules/
│   ├── platform1/
│   ├── platform2/
│   └── ...
└── rules-bank/
    ├── README.md
    └── ...
```
